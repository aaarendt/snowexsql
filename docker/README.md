# Snowex database in docker

To perform database setup, simply run from the root of the repository:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up
```

**NOTE: This assumes that [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) has been installed in your system.**
